This place is located in an unsafe neighborhood. We would go to bars and the locals there would say to be very careful because a lot of activity goes on there. Be careful of wearing certain colors in this neighborhood!! There was a lot of sketchiness that we witnessed. Where the Airbnb is located it just smells like sewage everywhere, even with the windows shut. Even though there is a code to get in through the front of the building, there is an alley that ANYONE can access and go up to your place. Would’ve definitely picked somewhere else to stay, if we knew how bad it was going to be ahead of time. I feel like giving 3 stars is even being generous.

Having the park and trail around lady bird lake right down the street was amazing. I took my dog to the dog park every day. We cooked a lot and the kitchen is well stocked. Some of the furniture is a little worn but overall the place is cute. We did not use the outside areas much as it was tough to keep the outside furniture clean but it was nice to have for the dog.

I would still book again even after knowing a few things!<br/>There were a few things of note that were disappointing and I think should be more transparent. The main one being that the pool hours are due to a very strict noise ordinance in Henderson—not just pool hours for liability and darkness. Nowhere is it listed as being a noise ordinance law, so we thought we’d be able to swim if we were careful and quiet. The fine if you do can be $1000. This is ONLY listed on a bulletin inside the airbnb. So if you’re looking to be at the house all day, it’s a GREAT place! If you’re out all day and want to have a relaxing dip in the pool when you get back, it didn’t feel worth the risk. I wish that was more transparent so we weren’t so disappointed.<br/>I also thought we’d be able to lay on the top deck, but it’s closed off.

It definitely deserves five stars. It is everything as listed. <br/>Upon entering the home, we did ask if there was any pets specifically cats because everyone started sneezing nonstop, and we came down to the conclusion that it was either pet hair, which we found all over the furniture and rugs or the dust of the air vents for the air conditioner. However, they did decline and say there was no pets there. But our allergies kicked in immediately. <br/>The house is beautiful and comfortable (aside from the sneezing) and it has everything you need. There was an ant problem.<br/>Our personal downfall on this home was finding stains on the bedsheets in two different bedrooms of the house. They were very inappropriate.

We didn't have any smokers but found cigarette butts in the backyard that we picked up.  Although trendy looking, the furniture in the main sitting area was not sturdy.  In the instructions there was an indication that any furniture broken would need to be repaired.  One of the chair legs was wobbly and the chaise lounge had a jerry-rigged repair that failed when my 84-year-old mother sat down.  The other concern I have is the landing at the bottom of the spiraled stairs that has a step down in any direction. There is a ""watch your step"" sign at the stair, but until one is attuned to it can be rather dangerous. My sister fell during the night. We then put a chair by each opening to remind ourselves the step was there.  Our suggestions would be to add lights, sweep garage, wash out garbage cans in kitchen and wall behind.

It’s a safe stay.<br/>As a host, I truly hate writing negative reviews, and I’ve definitely had worse stays…but there are a few things that travelers should know:<br/>The location isn’t as ideal as it seems with the “generalized” airbnb map. It’s tucked away in a complex on a street so that it takes 10 min just to get to the closest part of lady bird lake. 20 min to anything downtown. (Car or bike). Not a ton of time, but the photo made it look like I could walk in that time (vs an hour). It was a pain without a car.<br/>A few too many bugs considering it wasn’t hot (I know it’s semi unavoidable then)<br/>A few moldy spots in the tub, crazy dirty baseboards, and hair that wasn’t ours.<br/>If it were cheaper and presented as bare minimum, cool.

I  had to borrow a fan from a relative nto the house to try to sleep at night. One of our guests could not sleep one of the night due to the high temperature.

And when I messaged asking where I could find some cleaning supplies, I had no reply from her. The bed spread/blankets smelt like the previous tenants so that makes me feel it wasn’t washed before I got there. The apartment amenities were really cool, that was the best part of my stay. I asked for a refund of 50% if I left 4 days of 17 day into my rental and she wouldn’t work with me which is unfortunate considering the situation.

77681.0,547630304.0,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at Christiane's house!!! As two 20 year old girls, we wanted somewhere convenient and safe in a city we'd never been to before. It is so incredibly convenient to everything. Bunker Hill monument (where the Freedom Trail starts) is only a 5 minute walk away. The North End of Boston is about a 10-15 minute bike ride away. Highly recommend renting the Blue Bikes, as that was our favorite way to get around and really get a feel for the area! There is a bike station right down the street from her house. <br/>The neighborhood itself is so cozy and safe. We couldn't believe how quiet it was, considering how close it is to Boston! There are people walking the neighborhood at all times...families, couples, kids, dogs. We even walked the streets at night, because there were still people out and about and we felt completely safe. The streets are well lit with the cute and classic gas lampposts. There is even a little cafe (Anna's) right down the street... 2 minute walk away! We would walk to get our coffee there every morning before renting the bikes and heading into the city. <br/>Her home is historic, cozy, and quiet. She made sure to greet us when we got there, give us her free museum admission passes, and tell us a little about Charlestown. The room we stayed in was so quiet and clean. The TV worked great, the bed was so comfy, and the bathroom was stocked with everything you might need. There is even a sunroom that you have access to right by your room. You have that whole wing of the house to yourself, so it truly felt like a home away from home!<br/>We always felt like we were coming home to our private oasis every night and couldn't wait to crawl into that Tempurpedic bed. We loved the convenience to everything, whether it be a short walk, bike ride, or Uber to the city. Charlestown itself has so much to offer. We often found ourself often just riding our bikes through the charming streets and neighborhoods of that cute little town. So close to Boston, yet tucked away to make you feel like you could escape the business and come home to a safe and friendly community. Christiane made sure we had everything we needed and was great at checking in with us and making us feel like family. <br/>We loved our experience at Christiane's house and will definitely be back if we ever come to Boston again.

6716477.0,4.0142555110975104e+17,"We are very self sufficient travelers and did not expect much from this last minute trip.  All we need was a clean place with basic functions.  However, the place was able to disappoint even to that low low bar for $2,400 a week.  <br/>We’ll start with the positives:  good location for where we needed to be for the events we attended.  Clean rooms and comfortable beds.  <br/>Areas that need improvement:<br/>Furniture is very worn out to the point of not comfortable or safe.  All chairs around dinner table are shaky and loose.  You always worry about falling when you sit on it.  Hard to enjoy a good meal in such mood.  And we stayed six nights.  Sofa is very uncomfortable.  It is a old leather sofa with leather on both arms worn out and covered by some fabric woven covers.  If you sit on either part of near each arm, you’ll feel like you are sliding to the middle.  Only the very middle spot is comfortable to sit.  Imagine you have two people trying to fit in on the sofa.  No way you can find a comfortable seat after a day of events in the living room.  Would not think chairs and sofa are super expensive to buy but that’s what you got in this place.<br/>Smoke detector is a nightmare for us.  We just tried normal baking and had the exhausted fan at max.  The alarm went off like crazy.  We had to open all doors and windows to stop it.  Very hard to cook a normal meal.  We spent a week here and would like to cook once in a while but found it tear-some for such basic needs.<br/>WiFi: more a communication nightmare than anything else.  The owner/ property manager definitely has the WRONG login in information on the guest manual, which they put on the table in the middle of the room and expect guests to follow it.  We found WiFi was horribly slow and messaged owner and sent him pictures of modem, speed test and network name as he requested via message.  No solution until our last day there and told us that’s not the right network we should use.  The excuses were abundant: 1) there must be a page missing from the manual; 2) we tried but could not reach you earlier;...    Truth was there was no missing page and they have plenty of ways to reach me in a timely manner if so desired and attempted: cell, message, email.  They finally apologized for miscommunication but it was too late.<br/>Noisy neighbors:  this apartment is on the first floor.  The people on the 2nd floor were very noisy.  Apparently they have several some children who constantly running around and moving stuff.  And the walls are thin!  We have been out most of the day but for the time we had in the room, we could not enjoy a quite meal, or a good conversation without being startled / interrupted by upstairs noises.  They were loud.<br/>Do we recommend this place to anyone?  Probably not.  Do we want to come back to this place?  Most certainly not.",185,Chicago,1,1,1,0.8271,0.3612,-0.765,0.5938

Further away, research at the lovely Boston Public Library is a relaxing walk across the park and past the swan boats, and the ""T"" up to MIT and Harvard in Cambridge or down to South Station in town are also direct on the Red Line, so no changes and a quick commute!<br/>Overall, a wonderful visit.  <br/>",425,Boston,0,0,1,,0.8397,,0.9972

Two bathrooms plus an outdoor shower. Kitchen is awesome and has everything you need for cooking a full meal. Pool is NOT attached to the home, it is a short walk and is a communal pool. There was no one using it while we were there, but I could see it being a slight issue depending on group sizes, vibes and music taste. The hosts were wonderful, let us check in extremely early, checked in to make sure we didn’t need anything and the check out process is very simple. The directions given to get to the house are very accurate and helpful. I was able to find the home first try by going slow and paying attention but it is a tricky process and most of our group got lost, so pay attention!

The beds are very comfortable and there is a good amount of space between them, so you don’t feel like you are on top of each other like previous Airbnb’s I have stayed in. Considering we were a group of 20 dudes, space was a very important factor in choosing the Airbnb. We opted in for the pool heat which was the best decision ever since we spent most of our weekend in the pool. The home feels like its own private oasis- no neighbors in sight.

I spent my summer here for an internship and it was very conveniently placed since the office was in North Austin. There's a bus stop right across the street and a coffee shop right around the corner for your convenience as well. <br/>The people in my apartment were very lovely too and, although living with 14 other people sounds a little crowded, everyone works on their own schedule so it never seems like that many actually live in the apartment. Though the kitchen can get pretty messy if you have roommates that like to cook. But, the extra service fee for clean up is definitely worth it. Our bathrooms were spotless every week and the common areas never got overly dirty. A lot of stuff from toilet paper to pots/pans are provided too, so its a pretty good deal if you don't have any of that stuff. The only thing I had to bring really was a small shelf for clothes. <br/>The tenants were older than I expected (around the 21-30s range) but this did not lower the quality of my experience. Overall, it was really nice and I feel that I have made great friends with the other tenants.

I spent a few months here and absolutely loved it! Ernesto travels a lot so he may or may not be at the residence during your stay. But even when Ernesto is not at there, you can expect amazing communication from him. During the infamous snowpacolypse, he really went above and beyond to make sure the other tenant and I were safe and comfortable. If you have any questions or concerns, he will be immediately on top of it. <br/>Additional facts not listed, you may want to know: you have private access to an adorable, spiral staircase (door is behind the mirror) that takes you to the back patio. But note, the back patio can also be accessed directly by another tenant on the bottom floor, and by the parking lot via a code gated door. The patio also has a surveillance camera, as well as the shared common area, so safety is not a concern. The room also has a small retractable clothes rack hidden behind one of the curtains so you can hang some clothes (a few hangars are provided), and a small A/C unit in the ceiling with a remote control so you always have control of the room temp. There's also a desk located just outside the room, as well as a dresser. However, these are not private and are located in the shared area between this room, the bathroom, and the master bedroom. There are 4 bedrooms total in the townhouse.

And that's exactly what we did!<br/>I looked through dozens listings and finally decided on Bryan's. The pictures didn't do his house justice! The furnishings all looked brand new and everything was well cleaned. Everyone thought the house was amazing, it was definitely a highlight of our trip. <br/>Unfortunately Bryan couldn't be there to show us around (he was out of town), but he was sure to let us know ahead of time. There was however a nice lady to greet us when we arrived, showing us the house and answering any questions we had. It went smoothly. We were also left with a nice bottle of wine and a paper with notes and instructions, it was well written and came in handy a few times. I did have some trouble with the WiFi and when I called Bryan, he answered right away and helped me solve the issue.<br/>We were about a 15 minute drive from downtown, which was perfect since we planned on going out both nights. We waited no longer than 15 minutes for an Uber and it cost us around $15 to do so, which wasn't bad. This house could easily entertain for a night and next time we visit Austin, we'll be sure to do so (the speakers throughout the house and patio sealed the deal). <br/>This was my first time using Airbnb and thanks to this house, it won't be my last!<br/>Thanks again Bryan.",701,Austin,1,0,0,0.2732,,,0.992

That said, it is important that you all understand that there is some personal issue between the building owner/7-Eleven across the street and the ""late night"" community.

When I say ""blasting"", I mean it. Our party of six, including those who are considered ""deep-sleepers"", were jarred awake every morning at 6 a.m.-sharp to opera music.

The owner doesn’t seem to try and keep him/her quiet or stop the barking fits either… this is coming from someone who owns 3 dogs and has a tenant downstairs.<br/>A more thorough description or quicker communication would have prevented the grocery issue and I don’t know how much control the host has over the dog but I really enjoyed my stay otherwise!

Issues included broken screen, dead roach on the floor, broken fridge and freezer keeping everything room temperature, and bed bugs discovered at 2:23am on 5/17. We reported all issues (no one from my party was bitten), and didn’t get a response on the bugs until 8:51am, which only said that Air BnB will reach out for relocation assistance.

Also, as mentioned in the write-up of the apartment, the ceilings are low and would require anyone 5'10 or 6' to duck in several places.  Since we are both short, we were fine.

14809431.0,127233375.0,"My husband and I planned a get a way weekend without our 8 year old and as we both work full time, we needed time to reconnect and relax. We were very excited about our stay at Davids place! Upon arrival, a man named Hector answered the door. He seemed a bit confused on where we would be staying as David was out of town and his bedroom was locked, his roommate Kevin was in 1 room and then Hector and his child in the other (which was supposed to be our room). Hector suggested that we could have the bedroom and he and his son sleep in the game room. Each room in the house has a keypad lock, hector and I compared codes and we had the same door codes. So basically he had been staying in our room. Hector tried calling kevin multiple times and I tried calling David multiple times, no one answered. Hector had to leave and go pick up his child so there we were in a strange house with no direction on what to do for about 45 minutes. My husband and I debated leaving since we were unaware there would be another family present at our supposed to be get a way weekend. Next, kevin arrived and was sorry about the confusion. He was very understanding about our situation as we were led to believe we would have the whole place +/- David. Not another two people and a child. If we wanted to be around kids, we should've just stayed home with our own! Finally got into contact with David and explained our concerns, having no bed and another man and child present for our romantic and supposed to be relaxing weekend. He explained he was out of country and kevin was supposed to be handling everything. Yet, kevin denies having any control over the air B and B stuff. Kevin got on the phone with hector and hector agreed that he would just stay elsewhere so that we could have a more ideal get a way weekend. At first, I did not like the idea of this as we were basically kicking a man and his child to the curb to have our own weekend. Kevin confirmed that we should not feel guilty and deserve our weekend. After much contemplation and feeling incredibly guilty, we agreed. Hector to stay away until Monday so that we could have our weekend. David at first did not offer a refund of any kind because his listing does not say he can't have other tenants..but really it doesn't say anything about other tenants possibly being there either...then he went back and offered a significant refund which we denied since hector agreed to leave. Kevin was sweet and put the sheets and comforter in the wash. I moved all of hectors belongings out of the room and my husband and I settled in finally.

14809431.0,499493475.0,"David is a kind host, his dog is fun to be around, and the location of the house is convenient for getting to and from downtown—the commute was generally less than fifteen minutes each way.  The house was quiet and noise was never really any issue, especially after 11pm. <br/>The house was not as clean as I would have hoped.  Nothing terrible, but it was clear when I arrived the bathroom had not been cleaned, and the rest of the house was in a state of relative disarray most of my stay.  <br/>However, the only reason I’m even taking the time to fully write this review is because of how David handled the use of air conditioning in the house.  Upon arriving, David informed me that he had recently had high electric bills, so he was trying to save money by not using the AC.  Instead of simply including the cost of AC in the total cost of the AirBnB, like should have been done, I ended up having to negotiate for the privilege of using the AC.  Mind you, the negotiation was not about what temperature was reasonable to set the thermostat to, but whether the AC could be turned on at all.  In the end, I paid 1/3rd of the electric bill for my stay, increasing the cost by a little over 10%.  Even with the increase, I feel the room was fairly priced, however, it was not right to withhold something as basic as AC in Fort Worth during the summer and inappropriate to force a tenant to negotiate to use the AC subsequent to moving in, when it would be difficult and expensive to find different housing arrangements if he or she did not want to pay extra.  David argued that the house was not that hot and that he would turn it on later in the summer, however, the house generally sat at 78 degrees in the evening and the room for rent sits a few degrees hotter.  Absent the AC dispute and how David handled it, I would be rating the room considerably higher.",40,FortWorth,1,0,1,0.654,0.7717,,0.9308

37938133.0,743538334.0,"Such a phenomenal place! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed walking to and from restaurants, Starbucks, 7/11, and even just around the gorgeous neighborhood with our dog. The kitchen is SLAM packed with everything you could need from an apple slicer to a crockpot. There is storage galore with expansive closets, drawers, baskets, shelves, etc. all over the apartment. Both beds are very comfortable, but we chose to leave the murphy bed down since we prefer a king bed. The management team is so quick to respond and wants to ensure your stay is flawless. They do recommend you report to them with ""any dissatisfaction"" with the unit within 4 hours of checking in and I definitely would do so, whether you stay in this Airbnb or another (we learned the hard way). A few days after check-out, we were accused of damaging the desk/table and a vase and were asked to reimburse the owner for them, although we had not caused any harm to the belongings in the home or disrespected the unit whatsoever. The manager handling ""this situation"" with me has been a little unprofessional in regard to tone, grammar, and consistency. It has now been a week that we have been checked out and the manager still must ""get back to me with photos and more information""  and asked that I ""ask around to the people that stayed with us"" although we were alone during the entirety of our stay. They also added that we MUST have caused the damage ""unless somebody snuck in while we were gone"". This segment of our experience has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing, but it doesn't have to take away from the rental. It is a lovely spot, just be very thorough when reporting to them at check-in, and don't forget to clean regularly throughout your visit, despite the cleaning fee, as we were told we were ""very dirty"". Again,  I must be clear that the property itself was fantastic.",90,FortWorth,1,0,0,0.0039,,,-0.1455
37938133.0,3.963322445051891e+17,"The location of Suzettes place was great as it is very close to downtown Fort Worth and all of the amenities that you need. It is street parking only however the neighborhood is very safe and there were no issues with our vehicles. <br/>The apartment is nice and offers a private bedroom or a King size Murphy bed in the living room. There is not much seating space in the living area but the seating overall is comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking supplies and the appliances were newer and in good condition. <br/>If you choose to stay here, a few tips:<br/>1. The property is managed by a property manager, not the owner. There are 3 people that may be in contact with you regarding your stay and there is a lot of missed information between the three of them, it seems. <br/>2. Be advised, the property manager does not have a physical key to the property as it is a key code entry. We found out the hard way when we extended our stay and it appeared that our code had not been extended. When we called to resolve the issue, we were told we were doing it wrong, however, after about 30-45 minutes back and forth with Suzette, they did activate a new code for us. <br/>3. Take inventory of all items upon arrival and send it to the host within the 4 hour time frame. 8 days after our departure, we were asked to return a blanket that wasn’t present upon arrival and accused of replacing a wooden step in the stairwell. Yes, a single stair. Ridiculous. <br/>4. Do not expect to see a deposit back from Suzette in a timely manner, if at all. We checked out 13 days ago and still no response on our deposit after reaching out twice. <br/>5. The customer service during this stay was quite poor as we felt like more of an inconvenience to them than guests or paying customers. They are quick to respond, however very little help is offered when they are contacted. We felt more like tenants at an apartment than guests at an Airbnb. Unfortunately, this stay has left us wanting to move away from Airbnb rentals all together.",90,FortWorth,0,1,1,,0.7184,0.2484,0.8036

Drug dealers, homeless people everywhere..etc. the block we on had a few new houses including ours, like I said the house was beautiful but it doesn’t change the area. Multiple locals told us we needed to watch our backs and lock everything up. Especially having out of state tags. Police even told us this neighborhood was not safe, and to stay somewhere else if we could.

I will say Arian was prompt to fix it as she was unaware to of the issue and came to clean it herself. Unfortunately, we didn't  get into our place until 10:30 that night because of it. Past those issues, we had a good time. We thought the bed was a king, its a queen so one person had to sleep on a hideaway and we never received clean towels throughout our stay. But the location was superb and we had great free parking. All in all, without the check-in issues it would have been an amazing time.",150,LosAngeles,1,0,0,-0.6551,,,0.9196

15069489.0,198524210.0,"Im going to be very honest in this review, because I appreciate honest reviews when considering spending good money on a place to stay.  My husband and I stayed in this condo for 4 days and it was just OK.  The location is great, right in between Hollywood Blvd. and Sunset Blvd.  When we got into the condo there was no key for the unit, but the host was very quick to get back to me, and the security guard for the building came and gave us one.  Now for the unit itself.  It was very dirty.  The bathroom was clean, but everything else we questioned if someone had even come to clean the unit before we got there.  The kitchen counters were sticky,  the island chairs had yogurt, crumbs, and sticky stuff on them, the fridge was covered in greasy finger prints, the floors were very dirty as well.  After we asked for the unit to be cleaned properly, we noticed the maid was cleaning the floors with FILTHY water, obviously the same mop water she uses to mop the hallways, foyer, and whatever other unit she had cleaned that day.  Super gross.  When we looked closer, the vent fans were caked with dust, the baseboards were filthy, even the headboard of the bed had something on it that I wiped off.  The walls of the unit desperately need to be painted, because there are so many scuffs on the walls from moving furniture around.  The furniture has been moved differently from the photos to accommodate an air mattress and rollaway bed, but I just wish the host would have put them away considering we didn't need them.  All in all the location of this condo is great, but the lack of cleanliness, and the ware and tare of the unit did really hinder our opinion of this condo.  The host just needs to spend a week deep cleaning and fixing up the unit, then it would be a great spot.",150,LosAngeles,1,0,0,0.8959,,,0.9718

15069489.0,234448936.0,"I will start with the pros of this airbnb first. The penthouse flat was nice and spacious. Decorations were on point, and the host provided small amenities, like shampoo and conditioner. Location was great and within walking distance to grocery stores, dining, and lounges. It is also just a 10 minute ride to Universal Studios. Parking was gated and you needed a key to get into the building, so it felt very safe.<br/>The cons, however, was that the listing was very misleading. The listing description, at the time that I booked it, stated there was a King size bed and roll-away bed. When my party and I got there, we found out it was a Queen size bed and an inflatable Queen size mattress. Easy to work around, but we felt misled with the pictures and description provided. There were also minor things, like the blow dryer that was supposed to be provided, was missing from the box. The lock on the front door also needs to be fixed, or to at least let other renters know that you have to pull the door towards you while unlocking for it to actually unlock, because it's stuck and won't open otherwise.<br/>The host did not make as much contact as I thought they would, according to the impression I had from other people's reviews. I had messaged the host about check-in instructions, over 3 hours prior to checking in, and only got a response back when I was at the front of the building and calling them directly. Management/Maid service for the building also unlocked the door and attempted to come in the day before we were supposed to check-out, and also at 9:30am on the day of check-out, when it was stated that the check-out time is 12pm. The person said that the host had told them the wrong check-out date. I am not sure what would have happened to our belongings if we were not still there at the time. Also, a few times I contacted the host, but only got half a response (example: I asked 2 questions, but they only responded to 1).<br/>Overall, the stay was fine, but I'm unsure how others would enjoy their stay if they were not as resourceful.",150,LosAngeles,0,1,0,,,-0.4576,0.4235

He responded immediately to any questions I had and gave really great advice about things to do in the area.<br/>The rest of the home is organized and clean. I had full use of the kitchen when I needed and I loved soaking up the sun on the awesome deck. It’s also very quiet. <br/>I absolutely recommend staying at Philip’s!

He said that he was going to find out but never texted us back. Some minutes after the car left. But it would have been nice to just let us know if someone was gonna come to check the house or was gonna use the garage entrance. When it comes to he location, well it’s gonna depend of what places you want to visit, just as an example, we visited The Hollywood Sing, it took us like an hour to get there just because you needed to cross Los Angeles City to get to those places.

The property is extremely well kept and comes with plenty of amenities as advertised and then some (or at least more than i saw initially). The host is extremely responsive, helpful and easy to work! When we needed help or even an extra air mattress she responded immediately and even had an air mattress delivered to our door in a matter of minutes. Her and her clear do a great job at maintaining the place and providing great service.<br/>There is no need to look any further for another place to stay!

(Supposed to have been my phone number last 4 but that did not work until the following day) Our flight arrived at 10:30pm and we got there around 11pm and tried for almost 2 hours in the dark to reach someone to help us get in.  <br/>We were unable to reach someone to help us, and couldn’t find a hotel with vacancy due to CMA event. Airbnb support could not reach any of the contacts listed on the listing and our phones were nearly dead after a long day of traveling.  We had to pay a hotel and additional transportation to another location for the first night and then transportation back there the next day. (Nearly $300 additional with transportation costs and our room, and the owner did reimburse us $150)<br/>Airbnb support was great, however they were unable to help us. They even called and looked for rooms for us and called back to make sure we got somewhere safe. <br/>This property only has access through the back gate and drivers have trouble getting to you without confusion.

There were always plenty of Uber and Lyft drivers nearby for whenever we needed to travel somewhere farther than the main strip. The only bad thing about the location was that it was directly next to a busy street and fire station, so you could hear all of the sirens and loud music from the fire trucks and cars at all times. We were impressed with the feeling of security of this location because it was a gated complex. There were a few times where the neighbors would get loud though. We experienced an incident where someone came knocking on the door very aggressively, and there was no lighting outside of the front door to see out the peephole.

However Melanie was quick to remedy what we notified her of. The location was good and close to downtown. There was construction across the street that started at 8 am, along with an extra barky dog that was let out onto the deck across the road at 7 am. Also the snow around the apartment was never cleared by the complex and no shovels were available meaning we weren’t able to move the car for a week and the stairs into and out of the apt were straight up hazardous.

The air conditioner was not working the night we arrived , and Melanie offered no resolution or reimbursement, as is expected in a situation like this with Airbnb.<br/>I understand that Airbnb hosts are not always able to fix problems immediately, but I believe that Melanie should have been more proactive in addressing the issue. A handyman arrived to not be able to fix the issue and I received a text message stating there were three fans outside another unit to go get them and place inside the Airbnb. I am disappointed that Melanie did not meet my expectations as an Airbnb host. I believe that Airbnb hosts have a responsibility to be responsive to their guests' needs. Melanie failed to meet this expectation, and we paid full price without any refund or relocation to another unit.<br/>The location was nice-close to everything but uncomfortable to say the least.",129,Nashville,0,0,1,,-0.6757,,-0.8131

Ants happen and it didn’t ruin our trip by any means. Melanie made sure to send us through Amazon Now as soon as possible ant killing spray and trap gel which were used when needed.

32284822.0,6.029255998632929e+17,"If you're a young couple looking to stay for a couple of days in the heart of one of Nashville's trendy neighborhoods, look no further. The room is as pictured (albeit a bit smaller than expected but this was not an issue) and check-in was painless and simple. It's even 10 minutes from downtown, which is very convenient for people looking to experience Nashville's  night life. My only complaint (which is what knocked the two stars off) was that the AC unit did little to nothing to cool down the room. We had left for a couple of hours to get dinner and left the AC on 67, and when we returned it was still quite warm in the room. There's a remote to control the AC unit below the window, but it's not very intuitive and I believe it needs a separate set of instructions. In addition to this, the AC unit was quite loud, so if you plan on staying here and have trouble with noise I recommend earplugs. I think if you don't mind the heat or noise, you would enjoy your stay here. Staff was great with communicating check-in details and very punctual with their emails/texts.

Amazingly, it does exist and it’s a real steal.<br/>You have this brick townhouse just outside of East Nashville, it looks like a nice enough place, there’s plenty of parking and lots of mature trees. The price is reasonable and the host is friendly and fast to respond to messages. Seems like a nice - maybe above average - Airbnb. Then, you walk through that yellow front door...<br/>Cindy’s place does not seem like it should or even could be big, but it feels very spacious inside. The main living space has a comfy entry area with a chair for relaxing to get your shoes on or off. Then, there’s a beautiful little kitchen that just feels like it should come with a private chef (I looked in every drawer and cupboard, there was no chef). Moving forward from there, you can go left to the dining nook, a bright, roomy, warm & cozy spot, or right to a cute padded bench - because why not! You can never have too many places to plant your butt! Walk in a bit further and you’re at the living room: a cool retro couch, a few roomy reading chairs, and a convenient circular coffee table give you plenty of options for sitting and gazing at the tv mounted above the fireplace.<br/>Now, that all sounds great, but maybe you want more options for chilling and relaxing?! Open a door to the screened in porch and chill on the couch or a few padded lawn chairs. What a bonus of a space.<br/>The two bedrooms are both roomy and comfortable with lots of great style and decor touches.<br/>The bathroom. It’s a near personal spa! The large jetted tub is super relaxing, the double sink vanity feels like something you’d find in a fancy hotel.<br/>Throughout the townhome, the details abound. Style is everywhere, but never at the expense of comfort - that’s not easy to do. Beyond style and comfort, Cindy has thought of everything: she has jars of steel cut oats, cereal, and treats; there are games for the kids; notepads and pens at desks; a cooler for trips to the beach; bath bombs and bubble bath... I’m sure there were other things we never even saw or knew about that Cindy thought of and stylishly provided. She’s that good!<br/>Our family had such a great stay at Cindy’s place.

34683165.0,610079194.0,"This was my first Airbnb experience so I wasn't really sure what to expect as compared to a hotel. I stayed here for three nights for my destination wedding in Nashville with my daughter and husband-to-be. The home was very cute, and looked like the owner had added a lot of personal touches with a lot of care and attention to style. Here are my pros and cons. <br/>Pros: Beautiful neighborhood, very clean house, check-in was simple and efficient, the host was super quick to respond to any questions, the home and neighborhood felt very safe, the location is right near the highway and airport so getting around was convenient, the price was great, especially considering how expensive Nashville is, the bathroom was beautiful, the appliances were great, kitchen was stocked with supplies and even some snacks, coffee, etc., free wi-fi, toiletries in the bathroom, iron, hair dryer, and more.<br/>Cons: No TV's in either of the bedrooms, no live cable or network TV (only Netflix/apps etc.) in the living room. The furniture in the living room, while very visibly stylish, was really uncomfortable and not conducive to lounging around at the end of the day. The beds in both bedrooms creaked and groaned terribly loud. In the master, the mattress was a queen but the box spring was a full, so it hung off the sides, I actually ended up sleeping on the air mattress because I move around a lot when I sleep and I thought I was going to roll off, plus the noise was brutal.   The next door neighbor was smoking pot so when my daughter tried to sit out on the really nice back porch, the smell was so overwhelming that she had to come inside.<br/>There were also a lot of check-out items to complete, which I wasn't expecting, like taking the sheets off the bed, towels in the washer, take out the garbage, etc. Maybe that's an airbnb thing, I don't know.<br/>I can tell the host really cares about this place, so I feel bad about leaving the cons, but these are things I wish I had known going in.  Overall, it was okay, but I think I may just be more of a hotel kind of girl.",88,Nashville,1,1,1,0.9831,0.9831,0.9831,0.9283

The gorgeous kitchen had a very complete coffee setup for both drip and espresso and all the fixings, including creamer in the fridge, plus a tray of breakfast items such as little packaged pastries and cereal, not to mention the bowl of eggs in the fridge and welcome cookies that others have mentioned. Bring a stick of butter and a small container of milk for the cereal, and you'll be all set. We had a great time playing the oversized Connect Four game by the fireplace. We particularly loved hanging out on the tranquil screened-in porch. Touches like the coasters that looked like mini records were cute. The house is in a quiet locale about 15 minutes away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. You do need a car or be prepared to call Uber to get around; there's not much within walking distance. The beds were fine (except the sofa bed in the living room wasn't super comfortable, but it is, after all, a sofa bed, so what do you expect?)

The first night we had to call the police since the electronic lock started to open and we thought someone was breaking in.  The next day she brought door stops & changed out the batteries.  The 2nd night the lock unlocked again,  security light came on-my husband couldn't get it locked for a couple minutes.

Internet service was fast, steady, and consistent!!! A+++<br/>Overall this was a WONDERFUL experience and WONDERFUL place to stay! We can’t wait to return. Lonnie is very good at keeping in touch and replying to guests—rarely did we have to wait more than 30 minutes (or less) for his response. A+++++",92,Nashville,1,0,1,0.6249,0.8065,,0.9929

The check in process could not be smoother. The directions are written, but also come with pictures and arrows to ensure that going the wrong way is impossible. They were Steve-proof - I still have to use Google Maps in my hometown, so this was much appreciated. The amenities are just as good as advertised. I will miss two things specifically - the proximity to Whole Foods, and the HEAVENLY bed. I used this Kasa for an extended stay while my own furniture was in transit, and I am always hesitant to cook in other people's spaces (I know, stupid). I was able to take 30 seconds out of my workday, walk to the elevator, down a few flights, and right into Whole Foods for any meals that I needed. Additionally, this is my top-rated AirBnB bed (to the owner - if you're reading this - please send me the brand/model). Two final thoughts (if I don't conclude here, I will write a book) - the communication and location. I had one hiccup throughout my entire stay - easily fixable, just needed some info from the host. This was instant - I had zero stress, about a 5 second wait time, and the problem was solved. I could not have asked for a better virtual issue resolution process. Finally (I promise), the location is top-tier. My dog and I would routinely take a stroll down to Broadway in the morning, and there are plenty of green spaces to do what needs to be done. The Gulch dog park is a 10-15 minute walk away if the indoor dog park isn't cutting it. Again, WHOLE FOODS literally in the building. I feel like at this point, this review is not even coherent because there were just so many things I was pleased with. To wrap up - thank you to Kasa for allowing me to use your space.

We had to live out of suitcases in kitchen. I demanded some kind of compensation and they first offered only $75! Wasn’t happy with that so asked again.

We did enjoy our stay for the most part but there was also a few issues with the house.<br/>To begin the worst part about our trip was the shower leaking horribly. We felt as if we spent just as much time cleaning up all the water that would run onto the bathroom floor than we did actually taking a shower. The glass door seems not to be sealed correctly and I have seen this mentioned in a few other reviews.<br/>The other issue that seemed to bother me was that the landing was completely covered in about 3"" of mud due to improper drainage. I understand that it did rain fairly heavy prior to us arriving but don't understand how someone left foot prints throughout the mud but yet did not attempt to clean it up? This made it tough to keep from tracking mud and dirt inside even after I cleaned off the landing with the garden hose. Again we spent some of our time repeatedly cleaning the floor due to this issue.<br/>We are not trying to just complain although it clearly appears that this house was ""quickly"" refreshed in order to be used as the Airbnb. It can be clearly noticed that this house was quickly and cheaply updated to be used as an Airbnb.

The outdoor area was super cute equipped with a hammock and outdoor seating settled around a fire pit. I was sad that I didn’t see any firewood around but we wouldn’t have been able to really use it anyway because it rained off and on for the majority of our visit. Communication was top tier! Anytime I had a question the host was very responsive in a very timely manner. The house was very tidy and the beds were sooooo comfy!

Getting in and out was easy and the instructions were clear.  <br/>Here’s why they didn’t get a 5: the checkin is at 4pm, the checkout is 10am.  That’s an hour later checkin and an hour earlier checkout than most airbnbs I’ve stayed in.  They had an option for a late checkout, so I requested that - 2 hours for $50.  They made me put in my payment details and said they’d let me know if I was “approved.”  I had to message them a few days later to learn I wasn’t and that I wouldn’t be charged.  Also,a lot of Nashville rentals seem to be run by these companies with lots of properties.  They send you texts to go to a separate place for instructions.  Simple instructions that could be in airbnb, so you’re juggling multiple places for info.  It’s just not convenient.",142,Nashville,1,0,1,0.8442,0.0,,0.9547

Perfect for a weekend or friends connecting<br/>Feedback: typically folks are coming for weekends and nightlife most likely. We needed to work remote for the week and ventured to family friendly places in the evening. We had an infant with us, so this was our intent while our other kids were at a camp for the week. We intentionally filtered out duplexes and apartments from our search as we wanted a whole home (for space) and this popped up as a home. While the whole building is a house, it has been split into a duplex (unit A and Unit B). We thought we would have more space being listed as a home to set up our baby necessities and it was quite cramped. WiFi didn’t work and because it was unsecured, (no password needed), we didn’t bother to ask the host about it as we both have jobs requiring a secured network, so had to use hotspot. <br/>Again, perfect for short stays!!",142,Nashville,1,1,1,0.9571,0.4939,-0.3182,0.9846

There is a little marina restaurant across the parking lot in front of the home that had delicious food. The home was very clean and well kept. We had 8 adults staying during our trip; a couple in each room. I would suggest updating the description of the home to indicate that the 4th room has a trundle bed that is not ideal for adults. Also, that bedroom door is glass and is right next to the front entrance to the house so privacy is lacking - again, not great for adults but it’s a nice room for kids.

Pete is one of the best hosts I’ve dealt with on Airbnb. He responded quickly to all my questions and checked in with me during my stay. The listing and the pictures are very accurate. It was a comfortable stay for 5 adults.  Parking was great but I stayed during the week. As the weekend approached the parking lot started to fill quickly. The location of this Airbnb can’t be beat. It is a straight shot to downtown and takes about 10 minutes driving. It was a little too chilly to test the walkability of the neighborhood so I can’t attest to that.

Tremé is a lovely district and felt very safe and friendly (although like anywhere in NOLA I wouldn’t be walking about on my own late at night). <br/>French Quarter is literally blocks away, and the location is perfect for exploring everything the city has to offer - great for walking and driving.<br/>The house is incredible. Absolutely spotless, incredibly stylish and felt like our own home for 5 days. Backyard is lovely, we sat there a lot and really appreciated the nighttime lights and lovely courtyard vibes. Facilities are perfect, everything you need is here including washer dryer, cooker, coffee etc.<br/>Finally, Eric’s an incredible host. Great communication and he allowed us to check in circa 10am, which really felt like an extra day’s vacation - I’ve never had this from an AirBnb host before and Eric’s a class act!<br/>We were really sad to leave - but we’ll be back, can’t recommend this place enough!",152,NewOrleans,1,1,0,0.3612,,0.9513,0.9796

Not an upscale location, be ready for dirt and smells on the street.<br/>Smaller than on pictures, has only one window in living room for entire place. Which we could not keep open ( bugs and no mash screen) Oh yes, little window in the bathroom. Gunshot layout ( very New Orleans thing). To get to bathroom from living room, one has to walk thru bedroom and kitchen. Smart AC came handy. All of the appliances are working on gas, so, smell of gas can be noticeable sometimes. It was an issue with gas stove which was fixed in very timely manner ( Eric is superior host, applauds)<br/>Back yard was a decision maker for us, and it is nice, but smaller than appears on pictures, and three AC unites nestled there make a lot of noise.One also has to deal with neighbors to share the space.<br/>The major issue was a rocking toilet, can cause motion sickness lol. It should be fixed. <br/>Warped floors throughout entire place can do the same. Even underfloor is damaged, so, be ready for serous “storm” put on your scopolamine patch.<br/>Honestly, this place should be fixed. Especially to rent with this price.

Very responsive, very kind host. Look at a map before you venture out on foot-you are truly a block or two from the quarter. Recommend comfortable footwear because the sidewalks are old and you will want to walk the entire Quarter. So much to see. Bourbon Street because it’s a must, but don’t miss Frenchman’s for a calmer, jazz filled evening. Cafe DuMonde did not disappoint, just be prepared to wait.

That said, it was nice to have the option!

Only 3-4 small juice glasses (zero tall drinking glasses) and 3-4 coffee cups.  Very few plates or bowls…basically the cupboards were bare.

First, the listing's photos did not accurately represent the apartment. While Roami was prompt in replying to messages, there was a lack of action in addressing our requests. For example, I inquired about the type of coffee maker in the apartment before I left and was told it was a drip machine, only to find a Keurig-type upon arrival. Additionally, there was no shower curtain when we checked in. Despite Roami's assurances, the issue wasn't resolved until late the next day, thanks to a non-English speaking housekeeper who was unaware of the situation but kindly assisted us.

This showed me one glaring problem with the kitchen setup: using the gas burner stove-tops to cook will leave a heavy gas smell. The window helps a little bit, but the stove fan doesn't work enough to suck up that gas. The location isn't too bad, but it might be a bit much for travelers new to the NYC area (especially Harlem). The east side of Harlem isn't far enough to be out of mind, but since the apartment is literally across the street from a school, it's hard to feel too uneasy.

We requested a refund from the host for one of the rooms. The host gave one very quick reply, suggesting he would work on it but didn't. When I arrived at the hotel I was told that I only had 1 room, so I assumes that the host would issue the refund. After checking-in, I messaged VK  multiple times but he did not respond. I finally contacted Airbnb who said they would be happy to issue the refund but needed to contact the host for approval. The host also did not reply to Airbnb until they gave a 24hr deadline.  In the end he refused my refund and Airbnb  issued me an Airbnb credit.  I do not recommend this host because if you have an issue I don't think he will help.

It’s a 15 min walk from the nearest subway station, and abt 10 minutes from a grocery store/places to eat. The only unfavorable things I have to say is that we weren’t able to check in until 3:30 when the check in time was 3 ( don’t believe they were finished cleaning), as well as some pretty large roaches in the house here and there ( not a lot , very manageable) . Besides those two small things, it was a great stay. We didn’t have any problems with crime or anything of the sort",193,NewYorkCity,1,1,1,0.6486,0.0,-0.7351,0.7501

The washer and dryer did not work and when I notified the owner, he admitted that he knew they were broken before I arrived but forgot to tell me. (I booked for 30 days, attending school full time) When I asked about the washer and dryer the host said the best they could do was recommend a wash and fold up the street. Unacceptable. How insulting, that I have paid for a home with working amenities and then to be told to spend more money and time washing everything off the premises, including his old  bath towels, etc. <br/>There is a bath tub, but the water does not get hot so you cannot use it. I showered in the guest shower the whole time which was inconvenient. Everything in the home is old and uncared for. There is minimal effort in the details. Old bedding that smells, no TVs anywhere other than living area, and a pool table that was filthy. I mistakenly dropped the remote and it fell under the couch. There was old food and dirt all underneath. <br/> I contacted Air BnB and requested to pay for the time I spent there, (nearly 2 weeks at that point because host said a part for washer and dryer was on the way but never came ) and get a refund for the remaining two weeks I paid for. This is not an  unreasonable request given the circumstances. <br/>They ended up denying my request which is unacceptable. Part of the host’s responsibility is to make sure all amenities are working.

They were very thoughtful in making personalized recommendations for food and beer in the neighborhood, for a good, scenic running path suggestion-- and even offering to pick me up from the light rail stop.  Above and beyond!  Really, they couldn't be nicer!  Even the cat was friendly, for a cat ;)  The room was comfortable and breezy-- the airy window and ceiling fan made for ideal sleeping conditions.  The neighborhood was super cute and quirky and felt very safe even after dark (important for me, as I was traveling solo), though many of the shops were closed during the time I was there.  I arrived mid-evening and left early morning.  <br/>As much as I enjoyed my stay, I would note that this neighborhood might be best for those with a car or who are not as interested in being ""downtown,"" or who have more time to spend than just passing through.  Those three things for me made the location not quite right for me--- that's on me though. <br/> I was limited on time in my first visit to Portland, so was hoping to spend some good QT in the heart of the city, getting to know it.  I found that it takes longer than I had prepared for from Kristin's home to get to/from downtown by transit.  It is totally doable and there are MANY options, but it is not quick. Buses are very close by, and the light rail is ~1 mile.  This travel was just a little trickier to navigate with luggage.  I noted this with the lovely hosts (REALLY not trying to be difficult), and they graciously responded with an offer to pick me up.  I ended up walking from the light rail to their home because it was a BEAUTIFUL evening and I had been sitting, traveling all day and it felt good to move.   I ended up using Uber to get back to the city/Union Station after I left in the morning.  It worked out just right in the end, but I wanted to note this for other travelers.

11852482.0,728180176.0,"My husband and I needed to get out of our apartment for a long weekend and we decided to stay in the Portland area for a staycation.<br/>IndigoBirch was an excellent choice. Our stay began on Thursday when Curtis messaged us with a custom entry code and asked if we had a preferred temperature for the studio. Above and beyond!<br/>We arrived and the code worked perfectly. We were welcomed with a personalized note and a bully stick for our dog! <br/>The thought, intention, and attention to detail in this space is incredible. From the stacked washer and dryer (with detergent!) to the compact dishwasher to the full size refrigerator (with a Brita filter water dispenser) and freezer. The oven/microwave combo was a lifesaver. We broiled a round of brie for our charcuterie board the first night and baked cookies the next! They also have a nice toaster and coffee maker (we didn't use, but if we were out of town I'm sure we would have).<br/>The tv and sound system are really great as well, though we didn't use it. The heated tiles in the bathroom were a nice touch, the towels were very soft, and the shower was nice and hot!<br/>We spent a night by the fire pit and a night in the hot tub. The tub is unique! I don't think I've ever seen one like it — wooden, round. It was raining, so Curtis opened the patio awning covering so that we didn't get rained on. It was lovely watching our dog run around the garden with the smell of the fresh Portland air and the campfire wafting by.<br/>I honestly don't think there's anything that even remotely would be negative about this place. The location is wonderful (10 minutes from downtown, blocks away from Reed College). Hospitality 10/10. OH! The bedding. Incredible. There were feather pillows and Curtis also pointed out foam pillows in case we had a preference. Their sheets were from Schoolhouse, a PDX/NY home store and were incredibly comfortable as well.<br/>We will be back!!",157,Portland,0,0,1,,0.6597,,0.9929

No wonder why he is a superhost. Actually he should be in a category of his own. His past in being an executive in the hospitality industry plus a degree in the field shines through every last detail of this beautiful place. Upon arriving all of this was evident in the beautiful landscaping and overall look of the outside. Then walking up there is an elegant sign indicating the IndigoBirch. I was in amazement as I opened the door to this full upscale kitchen. I love to cook and this met every need I could have asked for. I was already in love and I was only 2 steps into this space. Everything just kept getting better as I walked through the entire property From the Westin Hotel Heavenly matress  to the amazing artwork to the top of the line appliances. I couldn't believe that I so happen to stumble upon this peace of Heaven through searching Airbnb. Adding to my delight was the Japanese inspired backyard garden. Just when you thought the front was the focal point, step into the back and you find yourself on a whole new level. They are not lying when they call this a Zen Garden. It was exploring this area when i came to meet Curtis and his husband Sean. What a power couple!! Their genuine response to this initial meeting was like I had known the pair for 20 years. Their help and recommendations for dinner and things to do were spot on. They truly know all the insider information for the area. To my surprise when returning back at night time after my days adventure, this beautiful place and backyard were then illuminated with precisely placed lights. Wow did that change the feel and vibe of everything.  I will never book another place except the IndigoBirch for my travel needs to the Portland area.

And then there are the Bosch, Miele and Smeg appliances, including gas stove (!!!), dishwasher, washer/dryer (!!!), fridge/freezer, toaster, tea kettle and coffee maker: everything you need to make yourself at home, but with nicer stuff than you probably have in your own home.

The soaking cedar tub- I genuinely wish came with an option to send scratch and sniff videos to anyone who hasn’t experienced it. The cleanliness is something I am HUGE about and usually bring my own sheets, towels, pillows and blankets but the place was so spotless and clean that it wasn’t even needed! The backyard is stunning even in the rain. I didn’t care it was down pouring- it almost made it even more peaceful. All in all, this place is cozy, tiny, spotless and the genuine care and thought  that went into every nook and cranny is something that you don’t get so lucky to experience.

11852482.0,6.095330376689073e+17,"If you are mulling over if you should pull the trigger on booking this, let me save you from sifting through twenty tabs and playing the comparison game because nothing, NUH-THING, holds a candle to Indigo Birch House. I haven't gone on a vacation in a decade and when my partner gifted us a week at this space for my birthday ---  my expectations were through the roof. Aaaaand Curtis exceeded them all. You may be thinking, there is no way a place could really be THIS magical. Oh, but it is. But enough of me setting the stage....what precisely makes this experience a worthy investment? <br/>THE GARDEN <br/>This fairy-tale of a garden was why we ended up cancelling our plans for the first three days. It is worth mentioning that we both had never been to Portland prior and while we had our days planned out to a tee, once we saw the garden in person, we spent the majority of our time soaking in the beautifully curated and intentionally designed garden space that led us into a deep, meditative space. <br/>THE CEDAR HOT TUB <br/>This was a main selling point for us. We took full advantage of the cedar tub every day and it was luxurious being able to soak while watching the rain pour over the stunning Japanese Garden with a glass of bubbly. It was the height of my existence, so far. <br/>THE INSTAGRAM-ABLE KITCHEN<br/>Your friends will be beyond envious when they find out you have SMEG appliances and everywhere. Jokes aside, the kitchen was easy to cook in, as there was plenty of dish ware, cooking utensils, cleaning supplies, storage containers and plenty of local teas & coffee for sipping on. Other favorite features included the dishwasher, the garbage disposal and gorgeous marble countertops. <br/>THE HOSTS<br/>Curtis was my favorite type of host and I will tell you why. Not only was he quick to respond to my many questions and requests, he was accommodating, gracious and contentious of our stay. I have stayed at many other Airbnbs where sometimes, the kind but unaware host will strike up a conversation or invite themselves in during moments where I would much rather be alone to relax and unwind. Curtis never lingered around the shared garden area or made awkward small talk. He was professional and anticipated our needs to a tee, so contact was minimal. That being said, when I did get the chance to meet him, he was lovely and I wanted to chat with him longer! <br/>THE BED, OH MY GOD THE BED<br/>Like most people, I adore my own bed. So when I travel, I anticipate not sleeping for the first few days. But the Indigo Birch Bed --- she hits different. I don't know what spell Curtis has placed upon those sheets but I slept like an infant/rock/mammal-in-deep-hybernation each and every night --- including the first. I also adored looking over at the garden every morning, rain gently knocking against the window just as I woke up.  Oh, and there were plenty of fresh Anthropologie sheets, blankets & more pillows stowed away, which was glorious of course.<br/>THE IMPRESSIVE STORAGE SPACE <br/>For the space technically being a studio, I was shocked at just how large the guest suite felt and believe credit is due to the smartly placed storage space. The massively large cabinet spaces hid our suitcases well and we had plenty of drawer space for each of us to unpack for a weeks' long stay. <br/>THE BATHROOM'S HEATED FLOORS<br/>Not only is the bathroom stunning and fully-stocked with plenty of toiletries, fresh towels and deliciously-good-smelling local soap, the floor is heated. Yup, you read that right. Getting up in the middle of the night, bracing your bare piggies to hit that cold tile --- only to be met with the inviting sensation of warmth --- I could go on but if you are still reading, it sounds like you'll be experiencing this glorious feature soon enough! <br/>AND ALL THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL LITTLE TOUCHES & MOMENTS...<br/>Curtis came to the door on my birthday to hand deliver warm and delectable popovers he crafted in his mother's pan --- presented on a bed-and-breakfast tray, which included mini ramekins of salted butter, delicate spreading knives and a single, Gerber Daisy, (unbeknownst to him, one of my favorite flowers) which bloomed in a sweet, clay vase.

Curtis made it easy for me to unload my 'stuff' as I intended to Stay In; read and watch movies.  How great to find a full Brita cold water tank in the fridge and plenty of space for me to fill the full-size refrigerator  with everything from fresh berries in the morning, to salads in the evening.

11852482.0,7.094494820113583e+17,"Here’s a description of IndigoBirch: you arrive with a certain expectation based on the airbnb description and photographs. But as soon as you arrive your expectations are exceeded. And after a few more minutes those exceeded expectations are exceeded again. IndigoBirch is just incredible. Everywhere you look there's an expression of what you might need as a traveler. As just one small example, in a closet you will find hanging two comfy bathrobes. Around each hanger is a neatly packaged eye shade in case you have a need for sleep during the day. And below these are two sparkling yoga mats. <br/>The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to perhaps even prepare a gourmet meal. All of the appliances are absolutely first class. The bed is so comfortable that you might have a difficult time getting up in the morning. And, we always love a clean place when we travel. The this airbnb is cleaner than any hotel, inn, or airbnb I’ve ever stayed in my life. Point of fact the word clean does not do this airbnb justice. It is detailed. They whole time we were there I never saw a speck of dust anywhere. In fact, it appeared that it had just opened and we were like the second or third guests. I looked back in the journal on the kitchen island, and saw it had been open for over a year. With plenty of guests. Just amazing.<br/>During our stay, my wife apparently broke her toe at one of the food pods. Barely able to walk, I called our doctor who told me how to treat it, but I needed a first aid kit. No problem, there’s a kit in the bathroom vanity! So incredibly thoughtful by our host, and so helpful that I didn’t have to run to Walgreens to hunt down what was required.<br/>This review would not be complete without mentioning the outdoor space. A few steps from the door is a beautifully landscaped Japanese garden full of peace and a wonderful place just to hang out. My wife and I had coffee there several times which is something we never do at home. We just sat around for an hour chatting, watching the birds, and listening to the gently babbling water running from a Japanese fountain nearby. Such a treasure to enjoy such peace created by this amazing space. On the last night of our stay we asked Curtis, our host, if it would be OK if we had a small dinner party in the garden, which he said was fine. We had family and friends over and sat at the beautiful table in the garden. When our guests arrived, one by one, you could see the wonder come over them as I led them into the beautiful garden. In this space, we had a wonderful dinner with great conversation and as the sun went down the lights hidden in the trees above came up providing a truly enchanting environment. IndigoBirch is now our home away from home whenever we visit Portland. Thank you Curtis for creating such a lovely, comforting, Zen-like environment both inside and out.

Check in was simple (as was checking out) , the place was clean, well decorated, comfortable, convenient and appeared as it does in pictures. The washing/drying machines were so helpful too. We had a car rental and didn't struggle with parking. Some cons: not enough mirrors if you're on a girls trip and everyone is trying to get ready. Also, there was only one roll of paper towels that finished within the first two days. Not a big deal, and we didn't even ask for more. I'm sure if we had asked, Omar and Amanda would have provided (that's on us). But other than that, not very many cons. Place was comfortable, convenient, safe and would definitely stay here again.

Or should I gush about their amazing space? I should confess that, usually, I'm that oblivious guy who barely notices his surroundings, but even I had to really appreciate their two upstairs bedrooms and common area. I stayed there for more than two weeks, but I kept finding more and more evidence of the time and attention they put into every detail. First, of course, there's the mini-fridge and coffee bar, which is stocked with incredibly good local beers and coffee -- as well as seltzer and an oversize Brita filter for the sensible non-drinkers among us. And then their furniture: funky couches and chairs that are both cool-looking and incredibly comfortable. And then the beds! My one regret is forgetting to ask what mattress they had in the bedroom I stayed in. I'm that sedentary office-worker guy with a horrible back, and yet I feel whatever condition I had has been cured after staying with them. Seriously, it may have been the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on.. Okay, I should stop talking about the space, since I lack the vocabulary to say much more. On to Scott and Cliff as people. They really were more than hosts, they were friends. I'm in Portland doing some fairly intense work, and on one of my first nights I came home frazzled and they were on the first floor having a glass of wine. They invited me to join them, gave me a glass, and we proceeded to have an amazing conversation. Scott does public health work and Cliff is a divorce mediator, who, if I ever figure out how to get married, I want to have on hand to manage the trauma of my inevitable divorce. Okay, I seem to have reached the end of the allotted space for this review. Let me just end by saying I was very sad to reach the end of my stay with Scott&Cliff.

The house has a classic San Francisco feel, it's in an absolutely gorgeous and safe neighborhood, and it's very centrally located and easy to get to most other parts of the city. The room itself was very thoughtfully designed, layered with bits of San Francisco history. It was cozy, had an unbelievable view, and had a super comfortable bed that we loved collapsing into after a long day of exploring. Maria and Pablo also were perfect hosts- they were so great to chat with and they gave us excellent recommendations and tips for experiencing the city (including tipping us off that we needed to make a reservation at Muir Woods, which we were planning on going to but would have been turned away at the gate... they literally saved the day for us!).

And most importantly, if you want to travel by public transit, Maria's house is an easy 9-minute walk down Eighth Street from Civic Center station, which will give you access to four of the five BART lines, several Muni Light Rail lines, and the F Streetcar line to the Ferry Terminal and the Fisherman's Wharf.

Julie's place is exactly the opposite of that kind of situation! Her place is very large, and truly has 6 private bedrooms, with none of the sketchy stuff where people count a couch as a bed or whatever. Two of the bedrooms are smaller and have twin-sized beds, but they are fine for a single person to sleep in.

You are provided with a full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave, coffee pot, pots, pans, dishes, utensils, towels, tv with cable, free internet access and etc..,.   The location was so close (approx. 5.5 miles) and convenient for us to get to USF .  It was in a really nice, safe and quiet neighborhood.  There was free parking at the end of a short drive way which was very convenient and a big plus in San Francisco.Rick and Suzzy are just so nice and friendly.  You can tell that they've put in a lot of thought and effort into making peoples' stay at Cactus Cottage an enjoyable one!  They displayed a lot of personal touches throughout the cottage.Honestly, my husband was really skeptical about booking a non-chain hotel accommodation through airbnb since we had never heard of  them and didn't have any friends that had used their services before.  I  personally was really hesitant  too because we're also not familiar with the SF area either so I didn't know if it was in a safe area, didn't know Rick or Suzzy, what the true condition of Cactus Cottage was going to be and etc..,.   So by nature we're very conservative and cautious when on unfamiliar ground so it was very unlike us to do something like this.  But since it was just the two of us without our kids we decided to take a chance.  In hindsight, it was the best move we made.  If we're ever in the area, we would book Cactus Cottage in a heartbeat!  Rick and Suzzy  were the perfect host and hostess!!!!!!!",75,San_Francisco,0,1,1,,0.8855,0.8651,0.9839

Monette was there to greet me and demonstrate how to use a finicky lock and key. Although she was away for part of the week, she kept in touch by text,  and made inquiries about my needs. She also bought new foam pillows because of my allergy to feathers! I had a drawer in the fridge for breakfast and snacks. This is a really beautiful house built more than a hundred years ago. As has been mentioned in other reviews, it would be wonderful if some repairs could be made to enhance the beauty of the house. A deep clean of the carpets and walls/ ceilings would also make things brighter. I always use ear plugs while traveling, but aside from some late night street noise, it was pretty quiet.

42042067.0,668880894.0,"Erin and Lindy's place looks charming and quaint, but the pictures of the location do not do it enough justice - there are 360-degree views on every corner.  While the place is perfect for a solo work trip or staycation (which I did ), it had close enough access to Bernal Heights Park that you could run it every morning and get a real sense of community.  As far as the accommodations, I am very grateful for the full and modern kitchen because I stayed for over six days and it saved me a lot of money buying groceries the second night.  But on the first night before settling in, I had enough sparkling water in the fridge and snacks to get by and I appreciated this consideration.  They came down with fresh baked banana bread and I was able to watch the sunset over The City through the front window.  Once you figure out the parking situation on Bernal Hts. Blvd. and street-cleaning schedule, you'll see that parking is plentiful here and that is rare all over SF.  My favorite part, besides the cable TV that kept me company, was the multiple seating arrangements and back living area and desk behind the bed.  I could do yoga there and work on my laptop after while still getting a view of the TV and The City.

The Pacific Tradewinds hostel lies in the middle of SF and we had a nice time there. It was packed with people from all over the world and both they and the staff there were super cool! 
Nonetheless, my sister was a bit unhappy with the fact that not only 6 people slept in one room, but also because of the open style of architecture, she was kept awake by the snoring and noises of all the dudes sleeping there. I had no problem with it, but if you have a light sleep maybe this isn't for you! It was reasonably clean, but I'd recommend bringing your own towels ;)

There was plenty of street parking available right in front of the house. This was never an issue. The house was very clean and spacious. Kitchen and baths had been remodeled and were spotless.CONSThe major complaint I have is that when I arrived I discovered a major ant infestation in the back bedroom. Ants crawling all over the floor and up the wall. This is not something I wanted to deal with after driving 6 hours. Went to Lucky's and bought some ant spray and that took care of the problem. I can tell there were ant problems previously in the living room, as some ant traps were placed along the base boards. The perimeter of the house should be treated by a professional pest control company, and a quick inspection prior to a guest's arrival would have been nice.

There is a TV in each room, and each was pretty easy to navigate - we used all three, and had no issues.

She always replied to any queries immediately and was able to solve any minor problems we had.

Furthermore, the fireplace in the living room is not functioning.  The kitchen is gorgeous but a gourmet cook would be hard pressed to deal with the mismatched, badly worn, and garage sale quality cookware, knives and utensils.  The beds are not recommended for anyone with back or sleep issues as a number of them sag.  You'll find signs everywhere instructing you what and do and not do, which would have could have been less obnoxiously communicated in the guest book or with a welcome letter.

Because it’s an old building, there’s no elevator so be prepared to climb 5 flights of stairs every time you leave and come back. This was not communicated prior to our stay and so it was very uncomfortable bringing our luggage up and down during check in and check out. Also, the hosts are rude, not accommodating, and tried to charge me $200 for a “clogged” bathroom sink which is simply not true!

We love having a private garage close to the beach.  The kitchen is very well stocked with lots of pots & pans, Tupperware, plates & cups, etc etc.   Our issue was cleanliness and maintenance.   There were several issues that should have been handled before we got there.  Examples include:  dishwasher not working properly, clothes left in dryer (and no laundry soap), broken window covering.  The good news is that these kinds of problems are temporary (!) and once addressed, the place is great.   Absent maintenance issues, I would give a 5 star rating.

Overall if you are good with a downtown kind of location and are OK with a dated house good place to stay. The patio is beautiful with string lights and candles.,360,San_Diego,1,0,0,0.4019,,,0.9658

And, there are 4 beach cruiser bikes and some beach gear you can use, so that was a nice bonus. Getting in and out was a breeze with the automated door lock. The one tip you should know is that the silverware drawer is interestingly located inside a bigger pot/pan drawer, so you have to look for it. It took us a while to find it even though it was clearly labeled inside the bigger drawer. Duh! LOL! But it just never occurred to us that there'd be a drawer inside drawer. It was kinda cool though.

His apartment is furnished with all the necessities one could possibly need and is more than spacious enough to be considered for a permanent living situation. During my stay, I was essentially a roommate who was treated with the respect and courtesy of a hotel guest! I had a spacious bedroom and bathroom to myself, access to a full kitchen (equipped with any cooking tool one could possibly need) and could enjoy a comfortable common space furnished with a monster tv, sound system, and Netflix/HBO/Hulu etc.. While all these home comforts will ensure you’ll have a relaxed stay at Jeff’s Airbnb, what lies outside his apartment will make it a truly unforgettable experience. Jeff’s apartment has an amazing outdoor deck with breath taking views of Tourmaline Beach and the Pacific Ocean. His complex comes with both a pool and a hot tub and Jeff is kind enough to provide his guests with access to his surfboards, wetsuits, and a bike! The beach is less than a block away and I often journeyed barefoot to and from every morning and evening to surf! Additionally, Pacific Beach is only a 10-minute walk (or a 2-minute bike ride) meaning amazing fun and food are only minutes away! Lastly, I could not say better things about Jeff as a host. He is friendly and welcoming and will gladly introduce you to his friends or take you on his adventures. In a 1-month stay at his residence, Jeff taught me to surf, took me snorkeling with sea lions in La Jolla, brought me to a Tom Petty concert, and introduced me to countless new friends. Whether its Taco Tuesdays at Shore Club or Comedy Night at Backyard, Jeff always has an activity planned and is more than willing to take you along!Thanks for an amazing stay Jeff!",110,San_Diego,0,0,0,,,,0.9961

Host’s only offer was to vacuum (should this have already been done before I checked in and how does this treat a flea infestation), provided traps for me to set up on my own and offered to reimburse for flea treatment for my dog, which he never actually did. Overall, I lost over $1000 plus the stress, bites, anxiety involved. I canceled and moved to a hotel early on and since we left, we haven’t seen any fleas or new bites so luckily it seems I got out before it became a problem that I could have brought back with me into my home.  Host will not take accountability and in fact said they would refund me only if they could find a new renter. That’s correct, they planned to rent to another person KNOWING that they have a flea infestation. This property has a pest control problem that they do not take seriously. I know fleas don’t bother some people so if that’s you, the property is well decorated and there’s a hot tub. But if something goes wrong, know that you’ll be hung out to dry. Air bnb is still investigating, I’m hoping that they will provide some protection for my financial losses at least.

If you are willing to spend over $200 a night at an Airbnb in this area, there are plenty of other rentals and even hotels that would be better than this. In summary, it wasn’t cleaned properly, stains on couch, location is ok but still drove or used transportation a lot.The location is alright. There’s a little market a block away that was useful for when we had to buy toilet paper because we were only provided a partial roll on the holder. Nice to have free parking with it, which could cost upwards of $40 per day at a hotel or another area. If you plan to be in the city, get a place closer to the areas you want and maybe skip the car. Or, choose somewhere else and drive wherever, but maybe not here.First, we found food particles in the fridge and microwave. Gross, but we cleaned most of it up and went on about our day.Second, after returning to the Airbnb after being out during the first day, we found hairs in the sink and shower. We noticed yellow staining on the cabinet about the toilet (like many people touching it after peeing…) and there were feces in the toilet still. Because of all these things we found, we didn’t feel it was cleaned properly and wanted out. This place was not cleaned to the standards Airbnb should have. Especially with covid.Third, we asked for a partial refund so we could look elsewhere and were denied. We were given a refund on the cleaning fee but had to stay because our money was tied up. My standards for a $1400 stay is way above what they provided in communication, cleanliness, and accommodations. Fourth, when we used up the partial roll of toilet paper, we looked all over the place for more. Eventually we went out and got some. When I told Mike and Ashley, they said they wished they knew about it because they had some in the LOCKED linen closet and gave us the code. We were not given a code, never told we could ask for it if we needed more supplies. They didn’t offer to pay us back a little since we left most of the pack there. They really struggled with communication and showing us the space properly (maybe because they had someone else do it). Other things to note:1. There were stains on the couch (big ones)2. The balcony is tiny and cramped with two large chairs, couldn’t even get onto it.3. The upstairs neighbors are so loud! They were stomping around all hours of the day.4. There was a ton of screaming outside on the street just below the balcony area.5. Pillowcase was ripped.6. Water controls are backwards in the shower so that was confusing.7. Very little storage. No dresser. Cant hang long clothes (dresses) in closet and no where to put clothes on a shelf.Noisy. Bad communication and customer service. Gross/Unclean.",108,Seattle,1,0,0,-0.2617,,,-0.8448

Shawn was super cooperative in allowing us to check in a few hours early, which was very helpful since we had too much luggage to do anything before accessing the property. Location was on a quiet hilly street which allowed for nice walks, however folks should either have a car or be prepared to use Uber liberally (we did, and they usually showed up inside of 5 minutes, so that worked well).

The thing that upset me the most was the front dest lady(?) who yelled at us for not properly using that intercom... and she really did not have to bite our heads off (especially, when she sees an asian girl and her parents struggling with 4 luggages on their hands, trying to figure out how the entrance works). It wasn’t anything that the hosts could prevent so, I am just writing it out to let the people who are going to stay at the Nest in the future know. It was my first time staying at Airbnb that required us to launder the bedsheets, pillow cases, and towels before our check out so, it made us a little time constraint in the morning.

32922642.0,464091817.0,"Lynne was very accommodating and fantastic with getting us a last minute early Saturday check-in after my girlfriend and I were forced to leave our previous Airbnb due to their fifth floor A/C shutting down right after our Friday evening check-in.With that being said, the townhouse is nice and all and close enough to the pictures shown but lacking in the cozy and comfort (demonstrated by most other Airbnbs) for stays longer than one night. Here are some of the main pitfalls:-There’s no propane tank provided for the nice BBQ grill on the patio (Grill should not be included in the listing IMHO)-The oven does not work at all and although not required by Airbnb hosts, it would’ve been nice to have salt and pepper and/or cooking oil provided at the very least. -WiFi connection was incredibly shoddy throughout our entire 3 night stay-Main ceiling fan in living room doesn’t work and room gets VERY WARM (no fan provided by host despite being told one was being delivered in an hour or so)-Coffee mugs were missing but provided for after asking-We had an incredibly bizarre request from the host (Lynne) of letting a very strange, homely looking Directv guy into the home to pick up old equipment at 11:00PM. After not sleeping at all at the previous night’s Airbnb, this guy didn’t show up for said equipment until after 11:00 PM and I’m sorry but that was just plain rude on the host’s part and should not have occurred. Weird.Other little things just started to bother us after that last one (the downstairs living room heat really didn’t help in all this) but yeah, there’s just zero decor of any kind in the home making the place feel strangely uncomfortable and creepy and barren with nothing but random furniture (bookshelves half put together upstairs, etc) strewn about.If you’re in a bind, Lynne can accommodate for sure, but with any kind of planning, I’d recommend looking elsewhere for stays longer than a night or two.

It's 3 stories from garage to bedroom so expect to deal with stairs while you're here.   The apartment felt quite roomy for the four of us with an open floor plan on the first floor and plenty of seating in the living & dining rooms, along with a convenient half bath.  The kitchen was well enough equipped that we were able to cook and serve a Thanksgiving dinner for six, lacking only a whisk to whip the whipped cream.  The upstairs bedrooms were roomy with two full baths.  Beds were firm but I slept fine.  The only complaint was from my wife, who is super sensitive to scents.

So if your a morning person anyway, this shouldn't affect you.  And even for me, this only lasted for about a 1/2 hour, when I could get back to sleep.I believe he has two accommodations and I stayed in the smaller/cheaper one, a single room with access to bathroom, kitchen, and I believe living room (I did not take advantage of the latter).

For starters, I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this rental. The location was perfect, a quiet neighborhood yet close to the cities and sites. It was within walking distance to the lake which had walking and biking trails. It was absolutely spotless!  The decor was beautiful!  There was plenty of room, very spacious yet still cozy. Kim even had the cupboards and refrigerator stocked with snacks, food, orange juice, milk, eggs, bagels, coffee, tea, chips and cookies and etc!! The only thing I personally would have liked was a tv in the sitting area in addition to the one in the bedroom, but that's just a personal preference. Kim's Little House far exceeded my expectations, it is obvious she takes great pride in the house and the rental cost is very reasonable.

The place was spotless, with a check-list of all surfaces cleaned, but also did not stink of industrial cleaners, which I so appreciated.  The bed was super comfy, the sheets soft and silky, and I slept like a baby every night of my 5 night stay.  Full kitchen and nice appliances made cooking easy.

12010614.0,188241870.0,"Overall we had a very pleasant experience at Allison's apartment.The best parts:- Dog-friendly: Finding a suitable place that allows dogs is tough, and Allison's apartment complex allows pets and it was a total non-issue. It was definitely a dog-friendly community in the apartment building and surrounding areas. I was worried the dogs would struggle with the coming-and-going door slamming of an apartment, but it was surprisingly manageable because the A/C had a smooth white noise to it.- Convenient location: I was near a ton of great food, infinity lakes and trails and walking opportunities, and everything I did was less than 20 minutes drive away - most things within 10 minutes. It's a different part of Minneapolis I hadn't stayed in before, and I really enjoyed Cedar Lake.- Quaint little spot: It's clear that Allison has put her personal creativity into the apartment to make it a fun place to stay. It's got a lot of charm and personality and felt very homey as a result.- Snacks & beverages: Though I didn't take advantage of this kindness, Allison was very thoughtful to welcome me and the dogs with some light snacks, coffee/tea and even a bottle of wine. It's the thought that counts.- Responsiveness: Allison had good dog-friendly recommendations nearby, always responded to questions promptly, and help was never more than a few minutes away if I needed it.There were some minor areas for improvement:- Apartment life means a liiittle bit of noise from neighbors if they have late night shindigs, or an occasional door slam, but honestly, not bad at all.- Window shades, pillows, linens and bed were on the cheap end. I would recommend replacing with working window shades that actually block light, and upgrading the pillows and blankets to be more comfortable at least.- The front door of the building does appear less than secure because it's been smashed and cracked. From the reviews, it sounds like it has been this way more than 2-3 months and has yet to be fixed. Might be worth a call to the landlord.- I was there for about four days and would've loved to have tidied up over that time, but there was only a broken broom that was about 1.5 feet long and no vacuum. Could be a nice replacement or addition.- At checkout, couldn't get the lockbox open to put the keys back. Allison was responsive and we arrived at a solve, though. Hope she was able to figure it out after I left.",195,Twin_Cities,0,1,1,,0.9814,0.6502,0.9979

It is a basement, however, the lighting is great, They run a dehumidifier, have two separate heating/cooling units so that you can change the temperature if you are in the ""living room"" or bedroom. I will typically bring my own towels along, but the towels here were very clean and in great condition. The toilet paper was not cheap-which counts for a lot in my book! They had a clean cooking area, with utensils & plates, pots/pans/etc. A Brita filter for filtered water. We stayed for New Year’s and they even left us a special surprise in the refrigerator.

38385816.0,7.275228114982835e+17,"Honest reviewPros: Great location, lots of restaurants in the area, French cafe next door. Nice sitting area w/ TV. Cons:Very old building. Long, curved staircase to climb; huge hole in the wall in the bathroom behind the sink; many cracks, tiny holes, exposed nails in the wall/floor and many crevices throughout the apartment. RAT box to the right of the entrance of the front door; saw some rats in parking lot scurrying around at night. I din’t see roaches but I felt the need to zip up my bag because there were just TOO many cracks and crevices everywhere!!! I was only there 2 nights 3 days days. I was attending conference, so I was gone most of the day. But, other reviewers HAVE seen ROACHES. Again, I didn’t see any inside but I saw some outside in the neighborhood! But if I would have read that review I wouldn’t have booked. Doug charges WAY too much to have pest/rodent issues!). Kitchen is tiny and it wasn’t a kitchen that I’d like to cook in anyway. Plus there we couldn’t find any pots and pans. Couldn’t even find foil to heat up take out dishes. Internet was shaky one night. We felt some racial hostility in the neighborhood from neighbors. It just felt like they didn’t see black people in that area very often based on some stares and questions we got as we walked around the neighborhood and went to local eateries. It didn’t ruin our trip, but  it was an annoying, tense and awkward part of the trip.Separate issueDoug accused us of smoking cannabis in his apt, which we NEVER did. Cannabis is legal there. There are 3 dispensaries within a 2 mile radius of the apartment. They even delivered. Once our business conference had concluded and we finished our last session, we put in an order for pre roll joints; and the dispensary delivered our order. We smoked a joint OUTSIDE,NOT inside in the apt!!! We don’t drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. We NEVER had guest or parties.Doug ASKED guests to “leave a gift that builds community” for the next people who stay. He lists this in his guest manual and he asked his guests to do this before they left. So, we left a Ginger beer (non alcoholic) and we left 1 pre roll joint sealed in an enclosed case. It hadn’t been opened. We thought, well let’s leave the pre roll joint as part of a “parting gift”; if Doug wants the joint fine. If not, he or the cleaning team could just throw it away or re-gift it. Again, it is perfectly legal to use cannabis recreationally in D.C. to the point where they deliver it to your home. We left the place completely SPOTLESS!!!!! I went out of my way to do that because that’s just my personality and I like to be a respectful guest. Read ANY of my other reviews and they will say the same thing!!!Well, on the last day, Doug’s cleaning people saw us standing waiting for an Uber. I smiled, waved and yelled “It shouldn’t be much to clean! We left everything spotless!” The cleaning ladies went upstairs, then after about 10 min., they come downstairs laughing and looking over at us. I literally thought they were happy we left everything so clean that they could be finished early! Apparently, his cleaning ladies MISTAKENLY thought we were smoking cannabis in the apt because we left the joint behind (they called it “evidence” as if we committed a crime) and then they claimed there was a “strong smell” of cannabis and accused us of smoking in his apt!!!!  The cleaning ladies opened the joint case to take a photo. And they removed the encased pre-roll from the kitchen table and brought it into the bedroom for a photo. This made it look like they found it in the bedroom. And I also think that opening the closed container contributed to the alleged “strong smell” of cannabis. Doug immediately sends me a text after receiving this fraudulent photo saying I owed him $1,000!!!! This is on top of what I had already paid for the stay - which was almost $1000 -  and now he wanted ANOTHER $1,000. He wanted to penalize me for “breaking a rule” and allegedly  smoking in his apt - which we still vehemently deny - he and tried to get me to pay $500 for a “deep cleaning” of his ENTIRE APARTMENT due to lie, which is crrrrazzzy!!! We had literally smoked a joint OUTSIDE nearly 3+ hours before we had to check out!!! Then, we both even took showers after we smoked and ate at the bakery next door before we headed to the airport! There wasn’t any lingering smoke anywhere outside nor was there any smoke or weed smell inside!! It just wasn’t true! And now this guy is trying to charge me $1,000 for a story he and his cleaning crew made up. That’s what makes me so upset! It is truly so cruel to treat people this way. To me, it was a HUGE misunderstanding!I misunderstood Doug’s “leave a gift” message. People leave bottles of wine, beer behind. Cannabis is legal in 38 states and me leaving that behind (for someone who doesn’t drink alcohol) was like leaving behind a decent bottle of Cabernet! If you want it fine, drink it or take it. If you aren’t interested, throw it away or don’t drink it. His cleaning people tried to criminalize the situation because the language they used to describe the situation definitely wreaked of some cultural, maybe racial bias. After reading through reviews, he’s had about 130 people stay with him and only 5-6 have been black identifying people; of those 5-6 black/brown people, half had an issue with their stay too! I don’t believe he nor his cleaning ladies encounter many black women guests (again that’s based on the reviews and how",135,Washington_DC,1,1,1,0.9244,0.0,-0.8272,0.9882

I was granted an early check in given the cleaning crew was done early; to my surprise 2 people start unlocking the door as I’m inside and scare the heck out of me. Apparently the host didn’t tell his cleaning crew that I would be checking in early. On top of that when i checked out, the host called me accusing me of being inside the property after check out- i was not.

32358982.0,5.564905296055131e+17,"I am a local who stayed here during a transitional period and the location is perfect.   It is steps away from the Dupont metro station and has a ton of great places to eat and shop at, but it is set back in a quiet neighborhood away from most of the noise.   You will hear city noise like sirens and such but I am used to that.  It was just me, but I found the place to be quite spacious.  I loved the couch and it pulled out easily into a comfy bed.   The bed in the bedroom also had a very comfortable mattress.   The owner provided ample sheets, pillows and towels.  The kitchen has all the utensils and appliances you need for cooking, there is a Roku and they had the fastest internet I have ever used in my life.    The owner responds quickly to anything you need. I did not use the washer/dryer but my understanding is that it is a shared one with the other condo units. Others mentioned that they had some issues with bugs, but I did not see any during my week long stay.   You cannot tell from the listing but this is a basement unit.   If you are a chilly person pack your sweater and some extra blankets, you will be cold.  I am always sweating and even I had the heat cranked up to 70 plus which is rare for me.   There are windows but little to no natural light.   The owner has provided a lot of lighting but it still tends to be dark and dreary and does not look as it appears in the picture.   There is no deadbolt or lock on the inside of the door, which made me a bit uncomfortable, I would prefer if the owner added that.  Check in was super easy with a coded entry but I think for added security a deadbolt would make the customer feel better.  At first glance I was concerned there were not a ton of power strips but I did locate a few of them and some extension cords in the drawer which were more than what I needed.   On some nights being next to the washer/dryer area was VERY loud and did keep me awake.   But most nights it was fine.  The shower head and water stream were nice and the bathroom seems to have been recently redone.    The furniture other than the bed, couch an table though are worse for the wear and could use some replacing.   The place was on the surface generally clean but if you moved the furniture around there were some pretty dirty spots the cleaners had missed.  But when I made the owner aware she was very apologetic.   There was also a coffee maker (would have preferred a keurig) and no coffee so I had to go out and buy some.   I would say this place could be a five star with just a few tweaks and just so you do know it's a basement location in case that is something that would bother you.",78,Washington_DC,1,0,0,-0.128,,,0.9821
